# Mac (vintage) to VGA adapter

To plug a VGA monitor on a vintage Mac with the DB15 connector.

See https://github.com/sfiera/mactech/blob/master/displays.rst for a lot of informations on the subject.

This was designed for my own use, the only goal was 'easy to solder'. Includes a basic 3D-printed two-parts shell to protect the adapter.

Works for me to get all possible resolutions on both a Quadra 650 and a LC III.
